## **About me**

I've been learned English for several years. In the future, I want to study abroad.  

I've been worked as a tutor in math and comuter science for a year. That time is a very great experience for me, because now I can explain complex things in a simple way and I am able to find an approach to any person.

I'm a fan of dancing and drawing. My most important hobby is self-development. I think that a person should develop not only in their specialty, but also in other fields in order to think more broadly.

In the summer I did my internship in my city at a company called 'I-sys labs' and I learned JavaScript. As an assignment, I wrote a website for learning English on Vue.js. I realized that I enjoy it and I really want to develop the direction of front-end development. 

My top priority for the near future - I want to develop in IT and become a frontend developer. I think that it so interesting and exciting. I belive that I can achieve  my goal and I am able to become a good specialist.

 ## **WORK EXPERIENCE**

 #### **Internship** 
 
 My training projects:

 1. The project on Vue.js called **EnglishWorld**. This is an application implemented on a framework Vue.js, the interface is written using Vuetify, and the cloud storage FireBase is used to save data. The animation in on the start page was written on CSS. That web-application was created for help to user learn English. The app is published on FireBase hosting.

 2. A JavaScript task is a slider. It was written in JavaScript, Html, and Css. The slider contains images that are already automatically flipped. You can also disable AutoPlay using the pause button and switch between the other two buttons. Images can be scrolled with the mouse and touched.
