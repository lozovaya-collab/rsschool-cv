                    I've been learned English for several years. In the future, I want to study abroad.
                </p>

                    I've been worked as a tutor in math and comuter science for a year. That time is a very great experience for me, because now I can explain complex things in a simple way and I am able to find an approach to any person.

                    I'm a fan of dancing and drawing. My most important hobby is self-development. I think that a person should develop not only in their specialty, but also in other fields in order to think more broadly.

                </p>
                <p>
                    In the summer I did my internship in my city at a company called 'I-sys labs' and I learned JavaScript. As an assignment, I wrote a website for learning English on Vue.js. I realized that I enjoy it and I really want to develop the direction of front-end
                    development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My top priority for the near future - I want to develop in IT and become a frontend developer. I think that it so interesting and exciting. I belive that I can achieve my goal and I am able to become a good specialist.
